# The python game

## Idea
 Idea for a game is taken from [Real Python site](https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/)

## Main goal
The main goal of this repo is to learn python3. Last version of python used by me was python2. Thats why I decided to learn it through making simple game in that language. Whole process of making the game is documented in videos (polish language only for right now). [See more info here](https://ggorecki.pl/stream)

## Installation 
* python3 -m python_game
* source python_game/bin/activate
* pip install -r requirements.txt
* python3 pythongame.py
